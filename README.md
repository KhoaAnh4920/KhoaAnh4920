## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Fullstack Software Engineer** with several years of experience working on long-term product development.

I’ve been involved in building and maintaining real-world applications, working across backend services and frontend interfaces, and collaborating closely with teammates to deliver product features in a practical, maintainable way.

I enjoy working on systems that have real users, real constraints, and real trade-offs — where clarity, reliability, and continuous improvement matter more than hype.

TestArchitect is a mature test automation platform used to support real-world software development teams in building and maintaining high-quality systems across multiple environments.

Working on this product over several years gave me valuable experience in long-term product development, cross-team collaboration, and balancing technical decisions with evolving product requirements.
