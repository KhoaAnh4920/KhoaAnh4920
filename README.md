## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Fullstack Software Engineer** with 3+ years of experience building real-world products, from backend APIs and databases to frontend interfaces, cloud platforms, and AI-powered features.

I enjoy working on systems that require:

- Clear architecture & scalability
- Real-world constraints (concurrency, failures, consistency)
- Thoughtful trade-offs rather than just “happy-path” code
